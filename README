This is not intended to be a complete app, only a simple code base and sample for those curious about working with JavaScript and HTML 5 to make iOS apps. This code does work on desktop browsers. There is some Apple specific code in the markup. However, in my testing this code is gracefully ignored in FireFox 4 and Chrome. Unfortunately, I have not been able to test this on an Android based device, however, it should work on Android OS 2.2 or greater with little to no modification. 

You are welcome to use this code as a base or reference for your own work if you so desire. I just ask that you contact me and let me know what you are doing with it and what modifications you are making; this is more out of curiosity than anything else.
